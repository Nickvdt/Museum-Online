                Do you see me? And how do you see me? Powerful emperors,
                flamboyant aristocrats and well-to-do citizens. Throughout the
                15th and 16th centuries, increasing numbers of people had
                themselves immortalised by the artists of the day. Remember me

                remembered.
              </p>

              <p>
                The desire to remember and to be remembered is a very old and
                human need. Since antiquity men has been making portraits, and
                the selfie is now an indispensable part of everyday life.
                Somewhere in between, around 1500, the first blossoming of
                portraiture in Europe began.

                Then, as now, the sitters were keen to be presented in the most
                favourable manner possible. All aspects of the composition – the
                facial expression, symbolism, pose, background and clothing –
                were carefully planned out. Where the one prioritised beauty,
                the other focused on exuding authority. Charles V, Holy Roman
                Emperor, for example, emphatically highlighted his power around
                1553 by having himself immortalised as a Roman Emperor. Remember
                me sheds light on how people wanted to be seen, in themes such
                as beauty, authority, ambition, love, family, knowledge and
                faith. How would you like to be remembered?

              <div class="subtitle">Document Nederland</div>
              <p>
                The coronavirus has had the Netherlands in its grip since March
                2020, and photographer Henk Wildschut has been documenting the
                impact of Covid-19 on life in Dutch society, and the country’s
                approach to coping with the virus.
              </p>
              <div class="subtitle">Distance</div>
              <p>
                Rather than engaging with the distractions of the day, Wildschut
                chooses to keep his distance and use his photography to reveal
                patterns. In this case the notion of distance is central to his
                subject matter, in a very literal sense. It’s also a subject
                associated with numbers, large numbers – of facemasks and other
                items of protective gear. Here, just as for Our Daily Bread, his
                previous Document Nederland commission in 2013, Wildschut’s
                lucid, ‘clinical’ eye captures compelling images that testify to
                the emptiness, distance, silence and scope.

              <p>
                Wildschut also reveals the human face to this crisis – the face
                behind the seemingly impersonal systems and high-tech equipment.
                These portraits are interspersed among the images of scenes
                outdoors, and indoors at laboratories, the RIVM public health
                body, and press conferences. Together they reflect how the
                government is trying to combat the virus, the consequences in
                our living environment, and the goings on behind the scenes.

              <div class="subtitle">Appearance</div>

              <p>
                In his images capturing distances and enclosed and outdoor
                spaces, Henk Wildschut reveals a country whose appearance has
                been temporarily altered. But the photographer does not pass
                judgement. He keeps his distance, to be able to show the volume
                of the crowds of demonstrators; the volume of the supplies of
                protective equipment – providing us with a clear vision of the
                extent of all the measures taken, and of all the protests
                against them.

              <p>
                The Rijksmuseum and Nederlands Fotomuseum’s joint acquisition of
                Ed van der Elskens’ artistic estate at the end of 2019 has
                provided the ideal opportunity to shed light on the working
                practice of one of the Netherlands’ most famous photographers.
                The display of more than 100 objects – including prints, photo
                book designs and contact sheets – reveals Van der Elsken’s hand
                in his photographs, printing and experimentation. This
                exhibition has come about through a partnership with Nederlands
                Fotomuseum in Rotterdam and is made possible with the support of
                Fonds21. The collection was for a large part donated by Anneke
                Hilhorst, and partly purchased with the support of the Mondriaan
                Fund, the Rembrandt Association (thanks in part to its dedicated
                Photography and Video Fund and Dura Kunstfonds), BankGiro
                Lottery participants, the Paul Huf Fund/Rijksmuseum Fund and the
                Marque Joosten & Eduard Planting Fund/Rijksmuseum Fund.

            In 1806, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte became the first king of Kingdom
            of Holland. The name of the museum was changed to Royal Museum. In
            1808 the Museum moved to Amsterdam. It museum was then housed on the
            top floor of the Palace on Dam Square. The museum also got a new
            director, Cornelius Apostool. After William I became king of the
            Netherlands, the name changed to Rijksmuseum. In 1817 the museum
            moved to another location in Amsterdam. A collection of prints
            became also part of the museum. In 1854 the Dutch banker Adriaan van
            der Hoop passed on his collection to the museum.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1855 the new building for the Rijksmuseum was completed. A night
            before the Second World War, all important paintings to safety. The
            paintings were stored in the caves of the Sint Petersberg near
            Maastricht. To not to notice, there was one from 1939 to 1940
            exhibition on contemporary art and from 1942 part of the collection
            of the Dutch Railway Museum.
